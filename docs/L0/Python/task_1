Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday,
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there
might be other options that are bigger for the
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected,
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it
to her.
